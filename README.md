## ðŸ”§ Steps Followed

1. **Data Loading**  
   Imported the raw `.csv` dataset into Power BI.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates and null values  
   - Standardized column names  
   - Converted data types appropriately (e.g., dates, numerical fields)

3. **Data Modeling**  
   - Created proper relationships between fact and dimension tables  
   - Defined one-to-many relationships where needed  
   - Implemented a star schema for better query performance

4. **DAX Measures**  
   Used **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to create important measures such as:  
   - `Total Sales`  
   - `Total Quantity Sold`  
   - `Unique Customers`  
   - `Product-wise Sales and Quantity`  
   - `Vendor-wise Aggregation`  
   - `Customer ZIP vs Quantity Analysis`

5. **Dashboard Development**  
   Designed two dashboards:
   - **Sales Dashboard**
   - **Quantity Dashboard**

   These visualizations were created using:
   - Pie Charts
   - Donut Charts
   - Bar Charts
   - Word Clouds
   - Filter Slicers for Date, Vendor, Customer, and Product
